## About the Video Course
Design patterns are intelligent, reusable strategies for solving common development problems faced by developers. For Web developers working with JavaScript, design patterns provide a tested, methodical plan of attack for tackling challenges that arise in real-world application development.

JavaScript Design Patterns 20 Patterns for Advancing Your JavaScript Skills will immerse you in the world of intelligent JavaScript programming, demonstrating to Web developers how to mobilize design patterns and presenting key programming concepts and common solutions to frequently occurring programming problems.

Exploring 20 different design patterns, this video course demonstrates the internal logic of each, while providing examples and real-world scenarios that developers can adopt and implement when programming in JavaScript.

The course opens by introducing the conceptual logic behind design patterns: what they are; what they are not; what makes a pattern; major pattern types; and what role they play in the bigger picture of Web development. We then dive straight into a real-world case study, building a mock application with in-built issues that design patterns can solve.

Following on from this introduction, the course quickly expands into exploring the core design patterns underlying the major pattern types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns. With the knowledge delivered throughout the course, developers will come away from JavaScript Design Patterns 20 Patterns for Advancing Your JavaScript Skills armed with a powerful arsenal for solving a wide array of different JavaScript programming problems.
